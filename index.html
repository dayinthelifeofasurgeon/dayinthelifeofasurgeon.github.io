        <h2>Have you got what it takes?</h2>
        Being a surgeon is stressful, fast-paced and tiring. Quick decisions are vital and you need to cope with severe pressure.
        You need to be calm, decisive and skilful and stay at the forefront of cutting-edge medical technology.

        <h2>A typical day...</h2>
        You head to work at your local NHS hospital, and today you're working the 6pm evening shift.<br/>
        <br/>
        You start the day by examining a cancer patient who has recently had life-saving surgery. 
        She is recovering very well, and you are happy to inform her she'll be discharged from hospital in the next few days.<br/>
        <br/>
        Moments later, you are called to perform an emergency operation on a car-accident victim.
        Surgery involves many hours of complicated repairs to internal tissues and the patient looks set to make a good recovery.<br/>
        <br/>
        Almost every day is fast-paced, stressful and tiring, but nothing is more rewarding than saving lives.<br/>
